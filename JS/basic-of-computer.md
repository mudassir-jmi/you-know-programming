# Learn Basic of computers

### What is computer ❓

🚀 A computer is an electronic device that processes and stores data, executing tasks through a combination of hardware components, including a central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage devices.

#### What is Ram ❓

🚀 RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a type of computer memory that provides high-speed access to data and actively used program instructions. Unlike storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, RAM is volatile and loses its content when the computer is powered off.

#### How does computer store information or data ❓

👉 We have all seen computers do seemingly miraculous things with all kinds of sounds, pictures, graphics, numbers, and text.

👉 It seems that we can build a replica of parts of our world inside the computer.

👉You might think that this amazing machine is also amazingly complicated - it really is not.

👉 In fact, all of the wonderful multi-media that we see on modern computers is all constructed from simple ON/OFF switches - millions of them - but really nothing much more complicated than a switch.

👉 The trick is to take all of the real-world sound, picture, number etc data that we want in the computer and convert it into the kind of data that can be represented in switches.

🚀 Computers Are Electronic Machines:- The computer uses electricity, not mechanical parts, for its data processing and storage.

🚀 Electricity is plentiful, moves very fast through wires, and electrical parts fail much less frequently than mechanical parts.

🚀 The computer does have some mechanical parts, like its disk drive (which are often the sources for computer failures), but the internal data processing and storage is electronic, which is fast and reliable (as long as the computer is plugged in).
